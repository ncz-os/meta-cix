# Ships the three Podman quadlet (.container) systemd unit definitions
# for the nclawzero agent stack on cixmini, plus the /etc/nclawzero/
# agent-env sample env file and basic permissions. Mirrors the bigpi
# (Pi 5 16GB) reference deployment — see
# ~/.claude/rules/handoff-3-agent-rootfs-2026-04-29.md for the full
# topology rationale.
#
# Quadlets are root-owned, mode 0644, in /etc/containers/systemd/.
# At boot, podman-system-generator converts them into systemd .service
# units in /run/systemd/generator/. Each agent runs as its own Podman
# container with the shared /etc/nclawzero/agent-env supplying API keys.
#
# This recipe ships only the unit/config files. It does NOT pre-pull
# the OCI images — that's done at first-boot by the (separate, future)
# nclawzero-load-agent-images.service which expects OCI tarballs at
# /var/lib/nclawzero/agent-images/{zeroclaw,openclaw,hermes}.oci.tar.
# The quadlets here have After=nclawzero-load-agent-images.service so
# they wait until images are loaded before podman tries to start.

SUMMARY = "Podman quadlet units for nclawzero agent stack on cixmini"
DESCRIPTION = "Systemd quadlet (.container) unit files for the nclawzero three-agent stack — zeroclaw (custom claw runtime), openclaw (NemoClaw OSS upstream), hermes (NousResearch Hermes) — plus the shared /etc/nclawzero/agent-env environment file. Pulls into images that include podman + systemd."

# nclawzero group ownership is set up by the cix-mini firstboot deb (or
# manually by the operator). We do not create the group in this recipe
# because Yocto's useradd-staticids workflow needs explicit group
# definitions in conf/distro/include — out of scope here. Document in
# README that operators must `groupadd nclawzero && chgrp nclawzero
# /etc/nclawzero/agent-env*` before agent containers can read the
# env file.
